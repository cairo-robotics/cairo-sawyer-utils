# Step 1: Download 'sawyer_setup.bash' from the Moodle and run it in a terminal (shortcut: Windows+T or CTRL+ALT+T depending on the machine) to set up ROS Melodic and the Sawyer control libraries (Sim + Actual Robot Controller)

# Step 2: Customize the intera.sh script for your project:
# Step 2a: Open the 'intera.sh' environment setup file
cd ~/ros_ws
gedit intera.sh

# Step 2b: 
#	Edit the 'robot_hostname' field and change it to reflect the robot you'll be using:
#	  For sawyer-1 (Electric grippper): robot_hostname = "021708CP00107"
#	  For sawyer-2 (Pneumatic grippper): robot_hostname = "021708CP00025"

# Step 2c: Edit the 'your_ip' field: (default looks like 'your_ip="192.168.XXX.XXX"')
# 	   Your computer's IP can be found using "ifconfig" command in the terminal. It'll likely be 192.168.something.something

# Step 2d: Save and close your intera.sh script

# Step 3: Run intera.sh to setup your environment to talk to the robot

## IF RUNNING SIM ##
cd ~/ros_ws
./intera.sh sim
roslaunch sawyer_gazebo sawyer_world.launch

## IF RUNNING REAL ROBOT ##
cd ~/ros_ws
./intera.sh

# Check to make sure you have the robot's topics showing with 'rostopic list'
# verify the ros connectivity with sawyer using: https://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/intera/Hello_Robot
